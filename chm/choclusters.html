<h2>Original Cho Cell Cycle Cluster Assignments</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This is the set of the original cluster assignments assigned
by Cho in his paper.  This dataset consisted of 384 genes 
separated by Cho into 5 clusters by phase. Genes whose 
transcripts peaked in a particular phase of the cell cycle were 
classified in a cluster belonging to that phase. For example, 
a gene whose transcript peaked in the early G1 phase was classified 
as belonging to the Early G1 cluster. Genes whose transcripts peaked 
in multiple phases were removed by Yeung for this subset. Because 
this dataset was separated visually by peak, we do not expect 
clustering methods to completely reproduce the original clusterings.

Here is a legend to the assignments:
<dt>1</dt><dd>early G1 phase</dd>
<dt>2</dt><dd>late G1 phase</dd>
<dt>3</dt><dd>S phase</dd>
<dt>4</dt><dd>G2 phase</dd>
<dt>5</dt><dd>M phase</dd>
